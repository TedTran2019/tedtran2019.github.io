As for my **background**, it goes something like this
- I was introduced to programming at an awesome cult-like school funded by an eccentric French billionaire called 42 all the way back in 2018!
  - It was one of the best times of my life, and I made a lot of lifelong friends as I completed various projects in the C programming language
- Upon returning from 42, I tried out a bunch of different avenues in life but none of them gave me the same spark as coding
- Fast forward, and I started working as a freelance software developer on the Upwork platform in 2022. A couple contracts I really enjoyed were:
  - Working with a PhD psychologist on a program to model learning in animals
  - Maintaining an automation system for processing orders for a furniture company
  - Authoring Ruby on Rails tutorials
- Soon after, I finally completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2023
  - As I was finishing up my degree, I also spent a lot of time contributing to open-source-- mainly GitLab as I really enjoyed their engineering processes!
- Then I started working for a startup called EvenHerd, where I developed an internal tool to manages and analyze stocks in 2024
- Later that year, I got a job revitalizing a website for a company called Infusense. It was actually a super interesting project because
  - I got to work with the EmStat Pico module and had to dive into their documentation
  - Utilizing the Web Serial API and dealing with its intricacies was a novel experience
  - The project I inherited was completely nonfunctional with zero documentation, tests, or coding standards
- Now I'm hoping to begin my Master's program at Georgia Tech relatively soon!
